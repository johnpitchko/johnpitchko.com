May was a strong month. The overall portfolio grew by over 9%, more than double the market benchmark of 4.5%. The overall net P/L of the portfolio is still negative, due to large downward price movements in long stock positions due to the COVID-19 market collapse in Q1. Most of those positions are recovering, but the large position in Ford (F) is still 40% below the position entry.

Four option plays were closed this month. XLE and XLF both started as short calls as an experiment in keeping the portfolio delta neutral. They rolled into straddles when the breakevens were breeched following by doubling-down on the puts to move the position into profit. Doubling-down may not have been the smartest move, but ended up working out for both these plays. The consequence is much higher fees.
