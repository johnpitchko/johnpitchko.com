For most of June, I had full expectations of having a very strong month. Out of the five trades that I closed this month, four of them resulted in gains. Total net profit from those four trades was USD $593.45.

Unfortunately, due to some errors or miscalculations in my tracking database, my XLB jade lizard resulted in a major loss. Analyzing the trade, I discovered that I opened the strategy back in February, just before the market meltdown due to coronavirus. The market swung pretty wild and the adjustments I made eventually went in-the-money, requiring further defensive moves. Some of the rolls I made to defend the position were not ideal (such as buying back an option for $18 then selling is for $16, incurring a $2 debit). In hindsight, this was the peak of market panic. I was worried that the markets would collapse and recovery would require significant time. I expect many other traders experienced similar feelings.

Looking at the overall monthly outcome, the results were actually pretty neutral. I ended up slightly positive before fees and lost less than $100 net. So overall, I'll declare the month to be a scratch and move on. My lesson from this month is to improve the calculations and formulas in my tracking database and to never blindly-trust the data. Before making any trade based on the information in the database, I will do a quick mental check to validate that the results are accurate.

I deposited $5,500 to the portfolio from my wife who asked me to 'make her some money'.
