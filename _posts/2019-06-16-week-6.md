categories:  weekly
---

Last Monday, the school leadership team hosted a strategy session at the [National Music Centre](https://www.studiobell.ca/). During the workshop, we determined the six areas of focus for the upcoming 2019-2020 academic year:

1. Program quality: enhancing curriculum and teaching styles to provide the greatest learning experiences that inspire and challenge both faculty and students.
1. Work-integrated learning: increasing and standardizing the number and variety of work-integrated learning options available to both students and industry within the school, ranging from more industry-sponsored capstone projects to four/eight/twelve month paid co-operative education programs.
1. Innovation: increasing support for faculty and students interested in implementing new ideas.
1. Brand and reputation: increasing awareness of the school to the general public.
1. International engagement: becoming more involved with academic institutions and enterprises in other countries.

On the Tuesday, we hosted the first program advisory committee meeting for our [Information Systems Security](https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/full-time-studies/diplomas/information-systems-security) program. Representatives from organizations  such as [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en.html), [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home.html), [Air Canada](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home.html), the [City of Calgary](https://www.calgary.ca), and others shared their input into the program. What was interesting, but perhaps not too surprising, was that much of their feedback aligned with that from our Information Technology program advisories - that graduates need to have skills in automation, cloud technology, and fundamental data analytics. As with virtually all other advisory committees, this group re-iterated the importance for graduates to have strong [power skills](https://blog.coursera.org/lets-call-soft-skills-really-power-skills/) - communication, teamwork, collaboration, creativity, critical thinking.

Now that all program advisory committee meetings and our key strategy sessions are complete, the leadership team will begin creating plans for program enhancement in preparation for the fall term. Expect to see a number of new content areas and work-integrated learning activities created as a result of this planning.
