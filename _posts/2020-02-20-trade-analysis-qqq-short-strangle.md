title: 'Trade analysis: QQQ short strangle, a lesson in overmanagement'
---

Here is a trade that I feel I overmanaged. I opened a short strangle, a neutral strategy, on QQQ on December 20, 2019. The bull market was unkind to me, causing the short call to be tested several times. Following my trading strategy, I rolled the short put up each time to capture additional credit. I was smart enough this time to make sure I captured enough credit (>$1.00 each trade) to justify the action with the high Questrade fees.

~~As of January 23, the open P&L is -$405 for the 222c and $15 for the 220p. If my math is correct, then my overall P&L for the play *should* be $175.13 if I closed the whole thing out. My plan is to follow *my trade plan* and exit this trade at 21 days to expiration, which will be January 31.~~

Wow, what a rollercoaster! I am glad that I (mostly) followed my trade plan and closed the 222c at (just about) 21 days to expiration. QQQ moved up to $236.98 as of Feb 20, so leaving that short 222 call open until expiration would have hurt even more.

It is true that I didn't completely follow my trade plan because I did not close the short put at 21 days to expiration. I was confident that QQQ would continue to rally so I wanted to try and extract as much intrinsic value as possible from that short put. I got lucky that the short put remained far out-of-the-money so I was able to buy it back very cheap.

I was very surprised to see that this trade was profitable before fees! This analysis shows the importance of being mindful of the fees being charged on your trades. It also shows the importance of minimizing the number of rolls that a trader makes because the fees (particularly Questrade's awful option fees) can quickly eliminate any profit.
