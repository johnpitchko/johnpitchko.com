  <p>Sorry Tim, but iCloud just isn’t cutting it for me. Firstly, I cannot use my personal domain with the iCloud mail service (meaning that I cannot use iCloud to access email that people send to john@pitchko.com, for example). Secondly, iCloud calendar has never worked properly for me. Whenever I send a calendar invitation from my home to work email account, I cannot “accept” the invitation. I click the “accept” button but always get an error message from iCloud. Apple, you make really great hardware, but cloud services is not your strength.</p>

<p>Sorry Tim, but iCloud just isn’t cutting it for me. Firstly, I cannot use my personal domain with the iCloud mail service (meaning that I cannot use iCloud to access email that people send to john@pitchko.com, for example). Secondly, iCloud calendar has never worked properly for me. Whenever I send a calendar invitation from my home to work email account, I cannot “accept” the invitation. I click the “accept” button but always get an error message from iCloud. Apple, you make really great hardware, but cloud services is not your strength.</p>

<p>I am now looking at other providers. I have web hosting from Bluehost, which does email hosting but not calendar, so that is not a solution. I will need to find a new cloud host that offers a complete package. Furthermore, I have multiple domains that I manage (pitchko.com and pitchkotechnology.com). I use both (one for personal, and one for business) so ultimately need to have hosting for both.</p>

<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

<ol>n  </p>
<li>n
<p>Email hosting with &gt;5 GB storage</p>

<p>Low price (since I will have to pay for and migrate my family email users too)</p>

<p>I’m going to compare <a href="http://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans">Office 365 Business Essentials</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/pricing.html">Google Apps for Work</a>. Here are my super cursory results:</p>

<p>[table id=2 /]</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Both services appear to be quite similar. The main differences are price (Office 365 costs $1.25/month more) and storage space (Office 365 offers an additional 20 gb of space). Currently, it is inconclusive so additional research is needed.</p>

<h1 id="further-research">Further Research</h1>

<ol>n  </p>
<li>n
<p>Investigate the UI for both products.</p>
<p>n  </li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>n
<p>Evaluate integration with core applications (e.g. Chrome web browser)</p>
<p>n  </li>
<p>n  </p>
<li>n
<p>Reviews from other users</p>
<p>n  </li>
<p>n</ol>
