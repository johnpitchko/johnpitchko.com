title: Eight things I learned about the Alberta Tuition Framework
---

In February 2019, the [Government of Alberta](https://www.alberta.ca/index.aspx) released an updated copy of the [Alberta Tuition Framework](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/9781460143155). The document specifies the policies around tuition and fees that students must pay to attend post-secondary institutions in Alberta. It also describes the procedures for adjusting tuition.

Below are some key items I learned from reviewing the framework:

1. The Government of Alberta considers post-secondary education to be a valuable investment with costs shared between the taxpayers and students.
1. Student associations are involved in annual disucssions with institutions regarding tuition and fees.
1. Tuition fee increases for domestic students in academic programs are capped based on annual changes to the [Alberta Consumer Price Index](https://economicdashboard.alberta.ca/ConsumerPriceIndexChange) (CPI). This rule prevents tuition from increasing faster than the average price increases for goods and services in the province.
1. A 10 percent tuition increase cap also exists for domestic students in academic and apprenticeship programs. This is the maximum annual tuition increase permittable.
1. A procedure for an *exceptional tuition increase* exists, allowing tuition increases higher than 10 percent in a year. An exceptional increase requires ministerial approval and appropriate justification.
1. Tuition for international students is decided by the board of governors for each institution.
1. Tuition for *Executive Graduate Programs* is not regulated. Instituions offering executive graduate programs must also offer a similar non-executive program with regulated tuition.
1. Institutions may charge students *Mandatory Non-instructional Fees (MNFs)* for specific goods and services that contribute to the learning environment, but are not related to instruction. The purpose of MNFs are to recover costs for offering amenities such as wifi, workout gyms, and health services.

As an adminstrator and graduate of post-secondary education, knowing how tuition and fees are determined is both useful and interesting. Looking at the specific regulation around tuition increases for domestic students, the government is trying to balance the needs for post-secondaries to grow its revenue while making education accessible and affordable to all Albertans.

I was struck most by the government's opinion that it sees education as a shared cost between taxpayers and students. Paying a percentage of tuition means that students have *skin in the game*. when it comes to their learning. Students should take their education seriously since there is a financial cost they must bear in order to attain it.

It is important that schools treat students as customers. They should not take their student body for granted. Students can choose to attend another institution if they do not feel they are being treated well or receiving sufficent value from the school they are attending. By accepting payments from students, post-secondaries are obligated to provide quality customer service or risk losing students.
