title: Benjamin Graham's Seven Criteria for Picking Value Stocks
---

My current investment strategy is __value investing__. I am seeking stocks that are undervalued by the market. Despite having a solid business foundation, sometimes the market mis-prices a company's shares, allowing investors to acquire shares at a relative bargain. The idea is that, eventually, the market will correct itself and the stocks will return to an appropriate price level. The investor can then sell their shares for a tidy profit.

Benjamin Graham is a well-respected authority on investing who wrote a popular and often recommended book called [The Intelligent Investor](). Even though the book was published back in the 1920s, Graham's advice and strategies are still relevant today.

Below are the seven criteria that Graham recommends value investors consider when choosing stocks to add to their portfolio. Thanks to [Cabot Wealth](https://cabotwealth.com/daily/value-investing/benjamin-grahams-value-stock-criteria/) for publishing the list.

1. __B+ or higher rating on Standard & Poor's Earnings and Dividend criteria.__

2. __Total Debt to Current Asset Ratio less than 1.10.__ Companies carrying significant debt should be avoided.

3. __Current Ratio greater than 1.50*__. Current Ratio is current assets divided by current liabilities.

4. __Positive Earnings per Share growth during the past 5 years__. Positive earnings per share (EPS) indicates that the company is viable with a low risk of not being profitable in the future.

5. __Price to Earnings ratio less than 9.0*.__ PE (Price to Earnings per Share) ratio is one way to identify companies trading at a bargain.

6. __Price to Book Value less than 1.20*.__ Price to book value (current price divided by most recent book value per share) can also be used to identify underpriced companies.

7. __Historical dividends.__ Sometimes an investor is stuck holding a share longer than expected. For example, a pullback on markets may push all stock prices down, delaying the investors ability to sell at their target price. If you cannot sell a share by the date initially planned, you might as well earn some dividends from it.

The points above can help to filter through the enormous list of available stocks for purchase to discover a subset of value stocks that have good potential for investment. However simply because a stock meets Graham's criteria does not mean it is a strong investment. Every value investor must investigate a candidate stock to learn why it is trading at a discount. The company may be experiencing a very serious issue which may be impossible to resolve in the short-term. In this case, a value investor probably wants to avoid this choosing this stock.

Graham's criteria offers value investors a simple way to identify great stocks. Companies that satisfy the criteria appear to be underpriced for their assets and earnings. They do not run the risk of being crushed by excessive debt.
