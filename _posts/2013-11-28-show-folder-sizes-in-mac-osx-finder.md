title: Show Folder Sizes in Mac OSX Finder

  <p>By default, OSX Finder does not show the size of folders. This is a bit of a pain when you want to know the size of an entire folder. Of course you can open the folder, highlight all the contents, and hit CMD-I, but this is kind of a nuisance. Also, I don’t even know if it includes the sizes of subfolders.</p>

<p>By default, OSX Finder does not show the size of folders. This is a bit of a pain when you want to know the size of an entire folder. Of course you can open the folder, highlight all the contents, and hit CMD-I, but this is kind of a nuisance. Also, I don’t even know if it includes the sizes of subfolders.</p>

<p>OSX Daily posted an article that explains how to do it.</p>

<blockquote><p>nn&gt; n&gt; n	n&gt;   * First, make sure to select list view from a Finder windown&gt; n	n&gt;   * Now open “View Options” from the View menu (or hit Command+J)n&gt; n	n&gt;   * Select the checkbox next to “Calculate all sizes”n&gt; nn</p></blockquote>

<p>The negative impact of enabling this option is that Finder may be a little slower/less responsive to use, since it now needs to calculate and update the file sizes for all folders. However, I doubt this will be a major issue. I think the benefit of seeing folder sizes in List view outweighs the performance hit. Of course, if you experience an inconvenient performance hit, you can disable this option.</p>
