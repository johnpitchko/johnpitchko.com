title: 'Wealthsimple vs Questrade XGRO: Part 1'

---
This experiment will compare the overall real performance of a robo-advisor (specifically Wealthsimple) versus a diversified single index exchange traded fund (ETF) purchased through a discount brokerage (specifically XGRO purchased through Questrade). These investment approaches are being compared because they offer low-fee investments that are aggressive and sufficiently diversified. They are also extremely easy to purchase and require no on-going maintenance from the investor.

The performance of both investment strategies are not being compared. Both investment strategies hold a broad mix of securities in Canadian, American, and international markets. Also, the ratio of asset classes held in both strategies is 80% equities and 20% bonds. The true goal of the experiment is to compare the total fees paid for each strategy so investors have an accurate understanding of the cost of a robo-advisor service. The question to be answered is, *for an intermediate investor seeking to maximize returns while minimizing fees and management time, does a robo-advisor provide sufficient value to justify the additional fees?*

The approach and results of the experiment will be reported through a series of posts. [Click here to see the on-going list of transactions, fees, and performance of the investments.](/wealthsimple-vs-questrade-xgro/). I will make best-efforts to not only document progress as it occurs, but to write the experiment *roughly* following academic methodology (i.e. explaining background concepts, referencing other material, describing the methodology of the experiment). Some of the pieces will be stubbed for now and expanded in the future. I am an 'amateur academic' so please reasonable expectations for the quality of the experiment and its reporting. I am interested in feedback, so please [contact me](mailto:john@johnpitchko.com) with your thoughts.

## About Wealthsimple

Wealthsimple is a robo-advisor service founded  in Toronto, ON. by Mike Katchen and Brett Huneycutt. They offer diversified low-fee index portfolios designed for individuals who want to maximize their investment returns without having to spend time managing their portfolio and paying fees for a personal investment advisor.

Wealthsimple offers three levels of accounts based on value of the investor's portfolio. The Basic level account, for deposits less than $100k, are charged a 0.5% fee. The Black and Generation level accounts, which are attained when an investor deposits $100k and $500k respectively, are charged 0.4% fee.

## About Questrade

Questrade is an online discount brokerage firm. Private investors can use Questrade's online platform to purchase a variety of equities, bonds, options, and more in registered (tax-sheltered) and non-registered accounts. As an online brokerage, Questrade is able to provide very low fees for investors.

## About XGRO

XGRO (or XGRO.TO) is the ticker symbol for the [**iShares Core Growth ETF Portfolio**](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/individual/en/products/239447/ishares-balanced-growth-coreportfoliotm-fund). The fund is an index ETF-of-ETFs created by powerhouse financial company Blackrock.

XGRO is an aggressive fund. It holds approximately 80% equities and 20% fixed income securities. It is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) but holds a blend of Canadian, US, and international assets. The benefit of trading on the TSX means that Canadian investors can invest Canadian dollars, avoiding paying a foreign exchange fee.

A major benefit of the fund is its low holding cost. iShares charges investors a management fee of 0.18%, with no management expense ratio (MER).

## Rules for the Experiment

#### 1. Each account will start with $10,000 funds at approximately the same time

Both accounts were opened on Saturday, March 23, 2019. Funding transfers were initiated shortly after Since this date was not a business day, several days may pass before both accounts are opened and funded. The impact is that the equity purchases through both Wealthsimple and Questrade may not occur on the exact same day. Any gains or losses incurred in the market between those two dates will benefit or harm the purchase price of whichever account was funded last. In an ideal experiment, both accounts would make their equity purchases on the same date.

The overall impact of a delta between investment purchase dates should be minimal. In reality, both accounts will make their investments within a few days of each other, with the market likely making small gains or losses during that interval. Over the several months that the experiment will run, the impact will be immaterial.

#### 2. Tax-loss harvesting will be enabled on the Wealthsimple account

I initially considered not enabling tax-loss harvesting because it would introduce an additional variable into the experiment. However, I changed my mind for two reasons.

Firstly, any normal investor holding a non-registered account with Wealthsimple *would* enable tax-loss harvesting because it, ideally, improves post-tax performance of the account. Ultimately, this experiment is seeking to reproduce the performance of the average Wealthsimple investor, who would undoubtedly enable tax-loss harvesting.

Secondly, tax-loss harvesting should not significantly affect the performance of the account. Tax-loss harvesting reduces total income tax owed on capital gains. The experiment is focused on overall unrealized performance, including fees.

#### 3. An *aggressive, standard* investment style will be used

Wealthsimple allows investors to specify their level of risk for their account. Investors can choose their preferred level of risk on a range between conservative and aggressive.

Wealthsimple also allows account holders to choose the theme of equities being purchased. The **Standard** style uses the default fund choices by Wealthsimple. Other options include **Socially Responsible Investing**, which invests in "low carbon, clean tech, or sustainable growth companies", and **Halal**, choosing funds that are compliant with Islamic principles.

#### 4. Only market orders will be issued

I expect that when Wealthsimple purchases investments, they do so at a market price rather than at a limit price. Note that this is unconfirmed, and may in fact be an incorrect assumption. Even if the assumption was wrong, it would be difficult to know exactly what at price Wealthsimple will seek to purchase an investment. Wealthsimple account holders can view their account activity and see the price and number of shares purchased, but it is impossible to tell if these purchases were made as market or limit orders.

Without knowing Wealthsimple's purchasing strategy, all purchases made through Questrade will be done as market orders.

#### 5. Wealthsimple fees will be reported as a Black account level

I currently have a Wealthsimple Black account, meaning I pay a fee of 0.4% instead of the typical 0.5%. This creates a slight advantage for Wealthsimple because I expect most average Canadians using Wealthsimple will be at the Basic account level.

In order to pay the 0.5% management fee, I would have to create an entirely brand new Wealthsimple Basic account. The effort would not be justified outside of the experiment; I certainly do not want to maintain two distinct Wealthsimple accounts, using two emails and two passwords.
