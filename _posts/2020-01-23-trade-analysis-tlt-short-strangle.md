title: 'Trade analysis: TLT short strangle'
---

I opened a short strangle on TLT just before Christmas 2019. I was attracted to the big potential profit and the additional 'fun' from being able to do more trades due to having to manage the position.

It was a rocky road between TLT rising steadily since that time and coronavirus fears which caused a sell off in equities as many folks fled to the safety of bonds and gold.

The outcome and lessons learned from this play is the same as for my [recent GLD short strangle]({% link _posts/2020-01-06-trade-analysis-gld-strangle.md %}). Too much undefined risk in tightly correlated underlyings. A black swan event (coronavirus) had major impact on both positions.
