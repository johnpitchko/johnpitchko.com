title: 'Trade Analysis: Inversion on $GLD Short Strangle'
---

On December 24, 2019, I opened 3 2020-Feb-21 145c/135p short strangles on $GLD for a $1.51 credit. Since that date, $GLD has risen by about 5%, testing my $145 calls.

On December 31, I rolled up the 135p to 138, adding another $0.28 credit.

Unfortunately, $GLD continues to rise steadily, likely due to US tensions with Iran after the Soleimani killing. On January 6, $GLD closed at $147, moving my short $145 calls in-the-money. My net loss on the strangle is just shy $800. Ouch!

To defend, my plan is to invert the position by rolling up my $138 put to a strike of $147.

| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | -----:| ------------------:| ------:| ----------------:| ---:|
| Dec 24 | Open 3 GLD 2020-Feb-21 145c/135p strangles | $1.51 |            $453.00 | $15.95 |          $437.05 |   $1.51  |
| Dec 31 | Roll up 135p to 138p                       | $0.28 |             $84.00 | $15.95 |           $68.05 | $2.35    |

[OptionAlpha recommends tracking the total credit captured during rolls](https://optionalpha.com/managing-inverted-option-positions-106780.html) to identify the impact of maximum loss when going inverted. Kirk specifically recommends to "maintain a net [total] credit that is higher than the width of the inverted strikes". Collecting $2.35 total credit so far, in addition to whatever credit I collect from going inverted, provides me margin to go wide on the inversion. I could roll up to a $147p and still have room to be profitable on the trade.

I will update this post as the play unfolds.
