  <p>Although I always enjoy taking a vacation, I really like coming home. Maybe it’s the familiarity of my house and city. Maybe it’s the slower (lazy?) pace of not spending all your time exploring an unfamiliar city. No matter, it’s nice to sleep in ones own bed.</p>

<p>Although I always enjoy taking a vacation, I really like coming home. Maybe it’s the familiarity of my house and city. Maybe it’s the slower (lazy?) pace of not spending all your time exploring an unfamiliar city. No matter, it’s nice to sleep in ones own bed.</p>

<p>Now that I have completed my graduate studies, I treated myself to a new gaming laptop. My  3+ year old iMac just couldn’t handle the performance needs of modern PC video games. Upon a recommendation from a friend, I picked up an Asus laptop from Memory Express. I forget the model, but I’ll post that tomorrow.</p>

<p>I won’t talk much of the specs at the moment. I will share my plan, which was to sell my iMac (and fund a future computer purchase) and transform my new Asus laptop into my primary computer. This made sense because my only other option was to use my MacBook air that only has 128 gb of disk space. The Asus has 750 gb; more than enough space for my music, movies, and tv shows.</p>

<p>I won’t talk of the horrors of windows 8, or my issues in migrating from OSX. That will take too long and I am tired. I can say that the process, including learning Windows 8, was a complete disaster. I just can’t get comfortable using windows 8. I don’t care for the Metro UI. File History is a poor cousin to Time Machine. I can’t find where any of the settings or configuration options are. There is no useful software available, like iPhoto (which I became very comfortable using) or Super Duper.</p>

<p>Perhaps I drank too much of Apples kool-aid. Perhaps I am just too old to openly accept change. Either way, I ultimately decided to maintain my sanity by going back to OSX, even if it meant using the MacBook as a primary computer. I think that I have found a way around this, which shall be a topic of a future post. I guess that now I am a true Apple man (*nix is pretty nifty too).</p>
