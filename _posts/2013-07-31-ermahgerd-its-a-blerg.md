  <p>I decided that I should finally get this website going. I had the idea to start a blog/personal website for several years now. However, due to anxiety/laziness/school I never fully committed to doing so. Now that school is over, and I feel rejuvenated and energized, I commit to launching this site!</p>

<p>I decided that I should finally get this website going. I had the idea to start a blog/personal website for several years now. However, due to anxiety/laziness/school I never fully committed to doing so. Now that school is over, and I feel rejuvenated and energized, I commit to launching this site!</p>

<p>I have some specific goals for this site. Firstly, I want to learn more about WordPress admin (since it is growing in popularity as a Content Management System). Secondly, I plan to use my school-free time to reconnect with many of my geeky hobbies, such as electronics and software development. I expect to use this site to share my creations and progress. By making regular posts, I hope to keep the momentum on my personal projects. Thirdly, from time to time, I come across interesting information and tips that I want to retain. Furthermore, many of this information may not be easily available to others with the same struggles, so I want to share it with the world.</p>

<p>How many people will read this site? Probably very few. But Sun Tzu said, “The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.”</p>
