excerpt: |
  <p>Kerberos is an authentication technology used by Microsoft Active Directory. It allows client to access network resources (e.g. file servers, print servers) without having to authenticate (or send a password) to the resource. Instead, clients authenticate against a Key Distribution Center (KDC) (aka Domain Controller in Active Directory-world), which grants individual reusable tickets that the network resource can consume and authenticate against the KDC.</p>
