Last week was [SAIT's](www.sait.ca) annual spring convocation. Congratulations to all the graduates who completed their academic journey and will now move on to the next phase of their life, whether that be further education or starting their careers. I was honoured to shake hands with the hundreds of graduates from [my school](https://www.sait.ca/about-sait/who-we-are/sait-schools/school-of-information-and-communications-technologies) as they crossed the stage after collecting their diploma. I am confident you will make the school proud.

Also last week was Father's Day. We played at the park across the road from our house in the morning, followed by a trip to [Golden Acres](https://www.goldenacre.ca/) garden centre to purchase some shade-loving ground cover plants. We have a fairly empty space in our front yard, which suffers from the shade created by the combination of large trees. My thought is that adding some ground cover foliage will help make the space look less barren while reducing the amount of mulch that will need to be bought and spread out annually. I planted those in the afternoon and swept out a very dusty garage, taking advantage of the opportunity to be productive while the kids were napping. After nap time, we enjoyed some fantastic ice cream at [Village Ice Cream](https://villageicecream.com/) in Brittania with the grandparents. Overall, a really great day.
