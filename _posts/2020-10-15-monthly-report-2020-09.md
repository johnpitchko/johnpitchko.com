Really pleased to have a month that beat the S&P 500!

Two earnings losers were closed this month (FL and URBN). These stocks really rallied after earnings. I was hoping the market would read them as overbought and bring them down a bit. That did not happen and my short calls were breached. Both positions were opened in August and despite rolling the puts up and the whole position out, I could not defend against the bull. Who would have thought that during the wrath of COVID-19, two retail stocks would climb so high so fast?

The PTON play was equally nerve wracking. I was in PTON since April. This stock rallied hard so I eventually capitulated and legged out the short calls and decided to ride the wave by stacking up short puts. PTON continues to go higher everyday, no doubt powered by the US's preference to sweat at home instead of going to the gym.

The straddles were decent earners, but I question the risk:reward ratio when the Tastytrade advice is to close short straddles at 25% profit. For cheap underlyings like NCLH and SLV below, I end up paying around 10% of my gross profit in fees. Thanks Questrade! Perhaps I will adjust my trading plan to avoid stocks under $25 or maybe even $50.
