  <p>I’ve been trying to free up precious disk space on my Macbook Air in order to run VMWare for work a little better. My 2011 MBA only has a 128 GB disk, which is less than ideal not only for personal use but also for running work’s large desktop image.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to free up precious disk space on my Macbook Air in order to run VMWare for work a little better. My 2011 MBA only has a 128 GB disk, which is less than ideal not only for personal use but also for running work’s large desktop image.</p>

<p>I used a tool called OmniDiskSweeper, which indexes your disk and sorts all your folders by size in descending order. I learned that my attachments folder, which stores all the images, audio, and video attachments in my Messages conversations, was a whopping 1.6 GB! Nothing worth saving here, so time to delete it all!</p>

<p>Go to your <strong>~/Library/Messages/Attachments</strong> folder, select all the files, and delete (Command-Backspace, or select <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Move to Trash</strong>.</p>

<p>Good bye goofy images, hello 10{02bfab78f16f002c08760f775fda675c0b55ee985408240fc63525afee6ba1cf} more disk space.</p>
