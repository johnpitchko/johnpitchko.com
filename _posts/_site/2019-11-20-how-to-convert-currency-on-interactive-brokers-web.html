<p>This guide walkthrough the steps to convert currency through the Interactive Brokers website. For this example, I will show how to convert Canadian dollars (CAD) to US dollars (USD).</p>

<p>Unlike Questrade which features a specific currency conversion function, Interactive Brokers traders must convert currency through a foreign exchange (forex) trade.</p>

<p>Currency can also be converted through the Trader Workstation application and the IBKR Mobile apps for iOS and Android.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log into the Interactive Brokers website.</li>
  <li>In the Symbol Look Up textbook, type <strong>USD</strong> and press Enter. Select the <strong>United States dollar - IDEALPRO Forex</strong> option, then select <strong>USD.CAD IDEALPRO</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Trade</strong> icon.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Quantity</strong> field, input the amount of USD you want to purchase.</li>
  <li>If you are comfortable purchasing US dollars at the market rate, change the <strong>Order Type</strong> field to <strong>Market</strong>. The <strong>Time-in-Force</strong> can be left as <strong>Day</strong>.   If you prefer to wait for a better rate, leave the <strong>Order Type</strong> as <strong>Limit</strong> and change the <strong>Limit Price</strong> to whatever rate you want to pay. You may also want to change the <strong>Time-in-Force</strong> field to <strong>Good-till-Cancel</strong> so that the order does not expire at the end of the day if the exchange rate does not dip to your preferred rate.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> button to view the details of the trade prior too submission. Verify the amount and commission. If you are comfortable with the details of the trade/conversion, click <strong>Transmit Order</strong>.</li>
  <li>IDEALPRO gives priority order routing to trades that exceed $25,000. If you submit a trade below this amount, you will receive a prompt indicating that your trade will be directed through a secondary route. This is fine.</li>
  <li>In a moment, you should see your trade be fulfilled, meaning that you sold Canadian dollars and purchased US dollars.  To confirm the order status, access your Orders &amp; Trades screen. Your filled order will be listed under Trades.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, IBKR does not immediately reflect your changed cash position in your portfolio. It may take between a few minutes and an hour to see the US dollar cash appear in your account.</p>
