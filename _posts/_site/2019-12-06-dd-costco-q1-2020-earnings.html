<p>Here is some quick (first time posting) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6j6gri/the_art_of_the_dd_for_beginners/">DD</a> on the upcoming <a href="https://www.costco.ca">Costco</a> $COST earnings. Q1 2020 earnings will be reported on December 12.</p>

<ul>
  <li>US national retail sales slightly up over last 3 months but large household item sales declined (<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/retail-sales" title="Trading Economics">Trading Economics</a>)</li>
  <li>$TGT beat earnings when it reported a few weeks ago, ‘smashed’ sales analysts forecasts (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/target-tgt-earnings-q3-2019.html">CNBC</a>)</li>
  <li>$WMT also beat earnings at recent report (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/walmart-wmt-reports-q3-2020-earnings.html">CNBC</a>)</li>
  <li>US consumer confidence is up, close to two year high (<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence">Trading Economics</a>)</li>
  <li>Costco reported over 6% growth in net sales for November YoY, and 5.6% growth in sales over the quarter. YoY sales for September and October also grew by between 5 and 6 percent.</li>
  <li>Retail sales from many retail stores ($BBUY, $TGT) over US Thanksgiving/Black Friday/Cyber Monday period broke sales records (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-best-buy-and-lululemon-were-thanksgiving-weekend-retail-winners-analysts-say-2019-12-02?mod=mw_quote_news">MarketWatch</a>), but technical issues on Costco’s website reduced online sales for the company during this period.</li>
  <li>P/E (35.8) trades high against comparables ($WMT: 26.85, $TGT 19.91)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion: bullish</strong></p>

<p>Trade: Put credit spread 17Jan20 285/280</p>

<p>Dipping my toe into the earnings game. The short 285 leg is closer to ATM than I would normally play (30 delta), but I am pretty confident $COST will meet or beat earnings, so I am comfortable taking on a little more risk. The longer expiration time also provides some time for the price to recover if it dips post-earnings.</p>
