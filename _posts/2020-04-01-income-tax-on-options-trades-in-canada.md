title: Income tax on options trades in Canada
---

Calculating income tax owed on options trades in Canada is a challenge. Little information or resources seem to be available online that clearly state what taxes are owed under what situation. I was able to piece together some information that should help options traders understand their tax obligation based on rules from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

### DISCLAIMER ###

I am neither an account or tax expert. The advice below is for informational purposes only and does not constitute advice. Traders are advised to contact an accredited tax expert for advice on income tax.

* Bulletin IT-479R from the CRA provides the most specific details regarding taxation of options.
* Proceeds from covered options must be reported on the same account as the underlying shares. I expect in most cases, this will be a capital account.
* Proceeds from naked options transactions are normally record as income, __however__ the CRA will permit individuals to record proceeds as capital gains provided the individual is consistent with reporting proceeds as gains from year to year.
* Proceeds from options are realized when they are sold. This note is important for options trades that span over the end of year. For example, consider a short naked put opened on December 15, 2019 and closed (i.e. bought back) on January 15, 2020. The gains from the open sale are realized in the 2019 tax year and the losses from the close purchase are realized in the 2020 tax year.
* One exception is when short options are exercised. Gains or losses from exercised short options are realized in the year that the exercise happens. Consider the same example above. If the short put purchased in 2019 was exercised in 2020 instead of closed, the gain or loss is realized in 2020 and not 2019. Any gain or loss reported in 2019 must be reversed through an income tax adjustment.
* Taxes are calculated on a per-option basis, and not per-order. This was a major challenge in my record keeping because I only tracked the gain/loss and costs of each order that I submitted to my broker. I had to document all my transactions for each specific option, nothing the date, price, quanity, and fees for opening and closing every single option.

## Key Takeaways
* For premium sellers, track open and closing information for each individual option.
* Be mindful of options that are opened in one tax year and closed in the next. To avoid this complexity completely, close all positions before the end of the tax year.
* Furthermore, prevent complications around exercised options by avoiding assignment as much as possible. This could be challenging for traders using The Wheel strategy.
