Congratulations to [Amos Ngai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amosngai/) who was the successful candidate for the role of **Academic Chair** for the new **IT Infrastructure** portfolio at [SAIT](https://www.sait.ca). I am pleased to have Amos  join the team, who brings some very valuable experience from his time as Associate Dean of [Bow Valley College](https://bowvalleycollege.ca/). Amos will be overseeing a new portfolio consisting of the infrastructure domains of SAIT's [Information Technology](https://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/full-time-studies/diplomas/information-technology) diploma (i.e. the Computer Systems, Network Systems, and Telecommunications majors).

This week I attended the 85th annual [Western Association of Broadcasters](https://www.wab.ca/) in Banff, Alberta. The conference brings together the radio industry, regulatory groups such as the CRTC, and vendors to discuss the future of the radio industry. I walked away from the conference with a few key learnings:

1. Radio is not dead, but the audience is shifting. Studies have shown more than 80% of people listen to at least some radio on a daily basis, with Baby Boomers and Pre-boomers listening the most. Younger generations (i.e. Gen X, Millenials) are listening to less radio and spending more time listening to streaming audio.

1. Diversified stations will survive. More and more stations are diversifying their channels and revenue. Stations that exclusively broadcast terrestrial radio ten years ago are remaining competitive by developing an advertising platform. Combining broadcast radio with internet marketing services, streaming audio, app development, and marketing analytics allow stations to now only survive, but thrive in the modern economy.

1. Diversified stations need versatile talent. As stations begin to offer broader content and advertising services, their needs for talent will also shift. The modern radio business requires workers that are skilled are more than just creating quality audio content. Candidates will require a broad set of skills that includes writing, data analysis, and social media.

My conclusion from leaving the WAB 2019 conference is that the radio industry is shifting, and schools like [SAIT](www.sait.ca) need to keep step. The future of the industry is more than just experienced on-air talent. People that will succeed in the radio business of the 21st century must combine many media production skills to create a variety of content types distributed through multiple channels.
