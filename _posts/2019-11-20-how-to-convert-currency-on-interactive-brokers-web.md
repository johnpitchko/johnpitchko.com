title: How to Convert Currency on IBKR Web
---
This guide walkthrough the steps to convert currency through the Interactive Brokers website. For this example, I will show how to convert Canadian dollars (CAD) to US dollars (USD).

Unlike Questrade which features a specific currency conversion function, Interactive Brokers traders must convert currency through a foreign exchange (forex) trade.

Currency can also be converted through the Trader Workstation application and the IBKR Mobile apps for iOS and Android.

1. Log into the Interactive Brokers website.
2. In the Symbol Look Up textbook, type **USD** and press Enter. Select the **United States dollar - IDEALPRO Forex** option, then select **USD.CAD IDEALPRO**.
3. Click the **Trade** icon.
4. In the **Quantity** field, input the amount of USD you want to purchase.
5. If you are comfortable purchasing US dollars at the market rate, change the **Order Type** field to **Market**. The **Time-in-Force** can be left as **Day**.   If you prefer to wait for a better rate, leave the **Order Type** as **Limit** and change the **Limit Price** to whatever rate you want to pay. You may also want to change the **Time-in-Force** field to **Good-till-Cancel** so that the order does not expire at the end of the day if the exchange rate does not dip to your preferred rate.
6. Click the **Preview** button to view the details of the trade prior too submission. Verify the amount and commission. If you are comfortable with the details of the trade/conversion, click **Transmit Order**.
7. IDEALPRO gives priority order routing to trades that exceed $25,000. If you submit a trade below this amount, you will receive a prompt indicating that your trade will be directed through a secondary route. This is fine.
8. In a moment, you should see your trade be fulfilled, meaning that you sold Canadian dollars and purchased US dollars.  To confirm the order status, access your Orders & Trades screen. Your filled order will be listed under Trades.

Unfortunately, IBKR does not immediately reflect your changed cash position in your portfolio. It may take between a few minutes and an hour to see the US dollar cash appear in your account.
