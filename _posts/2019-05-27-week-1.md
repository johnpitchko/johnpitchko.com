I saw someone on the internet who posted something every week. Most posts were brief; only a few paragraphs. Most posts were nothing noteworthy, just items from daily life. I think it will be a fun idea.

On the weekend, we took Brooklyn to a birthday party for her friend Anna from pre-school. The party was at North Glenmore Park. Unfortunately, it rained all day. Despite that, Brooklyn had a lot of fun. It is incredible how children look past things like rain and mud. Despite the poor conditions, she was focused on laughing with her friends and swinging on the swing set. If only we as adults had the same perspective.

One week has past since I seeded my lawn. I have been diligent in providing a light water twice a day, aside from a few days where mother nature sent rain. I feel a few blades have sprouted. Crossing my fingers for an awesome lawn this year.
