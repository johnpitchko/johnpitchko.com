<p>Here is, in my opinion, a concise but informative breakdown of two very popular CMS options; Drupal and WordPress.</p>

<p>Their conclusion is that WordPress is great for blog sites and small websites, and that Drupal is better for larger/enterprise scale websites and CMSes. I agree with this, although I have experience with WordPress only.</p>

<p>Part of the benefit of working with WordPress is the number of plugins available. There is a huge and growing number of themes and extensions that can really customize the look and functionality of a WordPress site. I do not know the range and scale of Drupal plugins, but I would assume there is a fair number.</p>

<p>The site also makes the proper conclusion that the right CMS depends upon your experience and needs. So one is not truly better than the other, it really depends on your (or your clientâ€™s) particular scenario.</p>
