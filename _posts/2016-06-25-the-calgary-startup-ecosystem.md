The Calgary startup ecosystem consists of a large collection of government agencies, non-profits, incubators, and accelerators that provide various support and resources to start-ups. I feel a major challenge with the entrepreneurs in Calgary, particularly the early-phase ones, is that they find it difficult to find these ecosystem players and understand how they can benefit their startup.

To remedy this, below is a list of various participants in the Calgary startup ecosystem.

First, I will recommend that all entrepreneurs start with the <a href="http://albertain.com">Alberta Innovators Network (albertan.com)</a>; a web portal with links to nearly all of the public and private startup support organizations.
