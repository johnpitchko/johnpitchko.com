We had a minor issue in our master bedroom of having too many electrical devices and too few outlets. Specifically, my wife needed her iPhone, bedside lamp, and baby monitor all powered and on her nightstand. That's three devices and with only two outlets.

The solution was to replace the existing standard electrical outlet with one that includes USB ports. I chose the [Leviton Decora 3.6A Duplex USB Charger 15 AMP](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/decora-duplex-usb-charger-3-6a-tamper-resistant-receptacle-15a/1000806312) available at [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.ca).

Installation was a breeze; shut the breaker, remove the old receptacle, install the new receptacle, and open the breaker. One feature that I liked about the Leviton receptacle were the two small channels to support the wires where they feed into the screws. They seemed to secure the wires well and hold it in place while tightening the screws. I think it also makes it look a little cleaner.

Another feature I thought was clever was placing the ground screw on the bottom of the outlet. Usually, the ground screw is on the side below the neutral wire. Placing on the bottom I feel makes it less confusing for newbie DIY'ers as it is clear the ground goes on the bottom.

A smooth, safe install that worked perfect the first try. Now we have enough ports to power all the gizmos my wife needs. A bonus is that the USB ports means she no longer needs to use one of those [Apple USB power adapters](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MD810LL/A/apple-5w-usb-power-adapter) to charge her iPhone/iPad.
