I am a product manager and innovation leader with 15 years experience leading global teams in information technology, startup consulting, and post-secondary education sectors.

Since 2018, I have worked as Associate Dean in the School of Information and Communications Technologies at [SAIT Polytechnic](https://www.sait.ca). In that time, I launched three new educational programs, doubled enrolment, and am spearheading new work-integrated learning opportunities. My goal is for every student to graduate with both a quality education and relevant work experience.

I am married with two children and live in [Calgary, Alberta](https://www.calgary.ca).

I also enjoy [trading options](/trade-performance/), improving my home, and making things out of wood.
