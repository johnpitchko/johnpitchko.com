## Educational Programs

### <i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Startup Primer

An introductory program I developed at for idea-phase founders that condenses topics of business model design, intellectual property strategy, fundraising and more into a single 3-hour evening.

This program came about as an experiment to determine if customers were willing to pay a small fee in order to receive some entrepreneurial education and consulting. The experiment proved successful with more than 50 customers participating in the monthly workshops which ran over the course of a year.

### <i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Discover

A six-week applied program guiding participants through the early phases of the Customer Development Lifecycle. Participants were guided through mapping their startup ideas onto a Business Model Canvas, then tasked with interviewing their target customers to confirm their assumptions. Results were analyzed in a group setting to identify trends and new insights. At the end of the course, participants presented their findings to a group of serial entrepreneurs to gather their perspective.

I authored the workshops, which I then delivered to more than 80 customers. These fledgling entrepreneurs conducted more than 200 customer interviews.

## Innovation/Startup Support Services

### <i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;[TELUS Technology Accelerator](https://www.platformcalgary.com/programs-and-events/telus-innovation-platform/)

A joint initiative between TELUS and Innovate Calgary to nurture selected Calgary-based startups in telecommuncations, digital health, and other technology sectors.

I designed and managed the [first cohort](https://www.platformcalgary.com/programs-and-events/telus-innovation-platform/telus-technology-incubator-tti/telus-technology-accelerator-cohort-1-participants/) of the accelerator. The success of the first cohort fostered the completion of two more cohorts as of June 2019, with applications being captured for a fourth. It also spun out a separate initiative, the [TELUS Technology Incubator](https://www.platformcalgary.com/programs-and-events/telus-innovation-platform/telus-technology-incubator-tti-2/), designed to support early-stage startups.
