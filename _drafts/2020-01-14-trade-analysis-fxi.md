title: 'Trade analysis: FXI short straddle'
---

Some interesting things going on with FXI. I opened a 41 2020-Jan-17 short straddle on FXI on November 22, 2019 for a credit of $2.24. IV rank was 35, which was low on the scale of 0-100. However, the historical volatility rank was only 30, meaning the current IV rank exceeded the normal range resulting in expensive options. I also expected an IV contraction.

The short call was assigned on Dec 16 because of an upcoming ex-dividend date. A similar event happened to me on the exact same date as on my [EEM short straddle](). It was not fun waking up that Monday morning to learn I was now short 200 shares of EEM and 100 shares of FXI! Lucky for me, the borrow rate for FXI was (and continues to be) 0.00%, so I am not in any major rush to close the position because its not costing me any.

By December 16, the remaining short put exceeded 90% profit, so I rolled it up and out. I sold a 2020-Jan-17/2020-Mar-20 41/42 diagonal put which closed my leftover 41 short put from the opening straddle. The resulting 42 short put was married to my short shares. I don't recall was FXI was trading at around this time, but I'm sure it was >$43. The idea was that if FXI declined a bit to below $42 but found support above $41, the short put would be exercised. I would buy the shares at $42 (on a cost-basis of $41.23 because I snagged $0.67 premium from selling the diagonal put) which would close out my short stock position. In hindsight, I should maybe have sold the $43 or $44 short put to increase likelihood of assignment to close the position while still capturing some credit.

Here is my current standing on FXI:

| Date   | Action                               |      Price | Quantity | Gross Debit/Credit |    Fees | Net Debit/Credit |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------:| --------:| ------------------:| -------:| ----------------:|
| Nov 22 | Open Jan-17 41 short straddle on FXI |      $2.24 |       -1 |            $224.00 | -$11.95 |          $212.05 |
| Dec 16 | Assign 41 short call                 |     $41.00 |     -100 |          $4,100.00 | -$25.04 |        $4,074.96 |
| Dec 26 | Open Jan-17/Mar-20 41p/42p diagonal  |      $0.67 |       -1 |             $67.00 | -$11.95 |           $55.05 |
|        |                                      | **-43.91** |          |                    |         |    **$4,342.06** |

Assuming my math is correct, then I can still profit off FXI *if*:
1. My Mar-20 42p expires worthless;
2. I can purchase FXI at <$43.91 ($43.42) to close my short position.

As of the time of this writing (Jan 14), FXI closed at $44.82, so I am unlikely to be buying shares at breakeven price in the short term.
