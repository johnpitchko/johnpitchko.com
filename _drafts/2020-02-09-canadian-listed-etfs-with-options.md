title: Canadian-listed ETFs with Options
---

Canadian option traders like myself may want to trade Canadian-listed ETFs that hold Canadian underlyings. A "Canadian-listed ETF" is an exchange traded fund (ETF) that is listed on a Canadian exchange (e.g. the TSX) and priced in Canadian dollars. Benefit to Canadians is avoiding having to convert funds into US dollars in order to trade, however that has advantages and disadvantages as well (e.g. currency risk). I believe there are also different tax advantages for holding Canadian assets in tax-sheltered vs taxable accounts.

Liquidity is important when trading derivatives because it means you can enter and exit trades easily. An underlying with very liquidity means you can get trapped in a bad trade with no ability to exit to cap your losses.

Measured total at-the-money open interest for calls and puts.

Used  March 20, 2020 expiration as it is the nearest back month because this article was written between cycles. The nearest front month is Feb 21, 2020 which is only 2 weeks away.

For comparison, the SPY has 21.17k open interest for calls and 12.15k open interest for the $332 strike for March 20 expiration (SPY closed at $332.20).

## Conclusion

The results of this analysis were disappointing but not surprising. Aside from XIU and XPR, none of the major Canadian-listed ETFs have an effective options market. Many underlyings had no options market at all.

For the two ETFs that had the most active option trading, XIU and XPR, the market barely exists. Most of the trades were at the money and very few, if any, were available deeper in-the-money or out-of-the-money, meanings strategies like vertical spreads and strangles are impossible.

The findings is that there is no real opportunity for trading options on Canadian ETFs. Much more active markets and trade opportunities are available on ETFs on foreign exchanges. There may be opportunity to trade options on US-listed ETFs that hold Canadian underlyings. Options include the iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC) and JPMorgan BetaBuilders Canada ETF (BBCA).
