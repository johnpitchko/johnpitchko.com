At SAIT, I sit on the Academic Policy Subcommittee, a group of faculty and academic leaders who review existing school policy and make recommendations for improvement. Recently, we have been reviewing our policy on academic misconduct, which covers issues such as cheating and plagiarism. One of my Journalism instructors, [Jim Cunningham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-cunningham-a89a172/), shared with me an article titled [Something Borrowed: Should a charge of plagiarism ruin your life?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/11/22/something-borrowed) from the [New Yorker] magazine. The author (one of my favourites) [Malcolm Gladwell] tells the story of a playwright believes she made an 'honest mistake' by lifting significant material from a book authored by someone else, resulting in significant damage to her reputation and career. However, Gladwell points out that so much art (music, writing, etc...) nowadays is 'heavily inspired' by another source, often without credit, compensation, or public scrutiny. Gladwell asks if the punishment for plagiarism can be too harsh, as it was for the playwright, in a world where so many artists are ripping each other off without consequence.

At SAIT, plagiarism is treated very seriously. Committing plagiarism can lead to suspension and expulsion (both of which I have seen happened in my first year as Associate Dean). Despite the growing social acceptance of artists and professionals improperly using the intellectual property of someone else, I feel that the harsh penalties that are imposed by academic policy are warranted for a few reasons.

First, instructors need to see the complete, original work of a student in order to provide appropriate feedback and evaluate a student's performance. Instructors must determine if their students are understanding the concepts taught in the classroom and are able to demonstrate mastery of the skill or subject matter. Copying
