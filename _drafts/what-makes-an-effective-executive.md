title: What Makes an Effective Executive

---
I was passed this article by Peter F. Rucker and published Harvard Business Review. Although a bit dated (published 2004), it provides some useful wisdom on how to be an effective leader in an organization.

* **Concentrate on one task at a time.** Easier said than done, but multi-tasking does not provide the creativity and attention-to-detail that can be created by focusing on a single activity at a time.
* **Set priorities and stick with them.** Maintain a ranked list of all the activities that need to be done, and focus exclusively at the top-priority. WHen that task is complete, review the list to reset priorities and move on to the new top-priority.
* **Focus on jobs you will do especially well.** No single executive is a master of everything, nor has the time to accomplish every task. An effective executive delegates tasks that he or she lacks expertise in to create the freedom to do things that he or she can do well.
* **Write and maintain an action plan.** Identify what work must be done and what the desired results are, and what milestones must be met. Include some specific checkpoints, such as halfway through the project and again upon its completion, to evaluate the outcomes against expectations. Use this information when the time comes to write the next action plan to include work needed to achieve goals that were not met with the previous plan.
* Make clear decisions. Whenever a decision is made or a task assigned, make sure the following is established:
  * The name of the person responsible
  * The deadline
  * Names of people affected, to gather approvals and overcome resistance
  * Names of people who must be informed, regardless of how much they are affected by it
  *
