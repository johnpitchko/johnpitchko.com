title: Find Your Why
authors: "Simon Sinek, David mead, Peter Docker"
---

An extremely useful follow-up to Simon Sinek's incredible _Start With Why_. I always struggled when trying to consider the WHYs and HOWs for organizations that I have been involved in. _Find Your Why_ provides step-by-step guides for both individuals and organizations seeking to codify their mission and values. The methodology is successful because it begins with users reminiscing about the stories and moments in their past, something that any individual or group of people can easily do. Afterwards, the book describes how to analyze the stories to look for patterns and themes that are most impactful. which after some refinement evolve into the WHY and HOW statements.

An easy read that transforms a nebulous, philosophical question about WHY we do what do into something approachable by individuals of all experience levels. Every leader should invest the time to run through this process with their team. The outcome will not only align individuals toward a common, concrete purpose for the organization, but connects team members to the organization thrrough a powerful emotional connection.

## Key Learnings

### Recap from __Start With Why__

  * __WHATs__ are products and services produced by an individual or team.
  * __HOWs__ are the values and guiding principles that create competitive advantage or make the individual or team unique.
  * __WHYs__ defines the purpose for existence, the single highest-priority mission.

### How to Discover your Why

1. __Gather stories and share them.__ Be specific and avoid general stories. Seek stories that made the biggest difference in your life. Extract the verbs and action phrases.
1. __Identify (and select) themes.__ Look for recurring words, emotions, phrases.  Choose a few (one, two, or three) that have the most impact.
1. __Draft and refine WHY statement.__ Build something simple, actionable, and focused. Put it into the format _"To <contribution> so that <impact>."_ Be comfortable starting with something unpolished and refine it to something powerful and genuine.
1. __Narrow remaining themes and state your HOWs.__ Different individuals or organizations may have the same or similar WHY statements. However, it is the HOWs that differentiate the two entities and can highlight competitive advantage. The HOWs are what bring a WHY to life.

__Remember:__ The WHY and HOW statements are not aspirational. Instead, they reflect current beliefs and reality.

For individuals, recommend working with a partner. Can help ask probing questions to extract deeper answers. Seek primal and emotional responses.

For groups, consider _nested WHY statements_. The WHY for an organization inspires the WHY for a division, which inspires the WHY for a team.

Groups should try to answer the questions:
  * When specifically feel the most proud to work for the organization?
  * What was specific contribution your organization made to the lives of others?
  * What did the contributions of your organization allow others to go on to _do_ or _be_?
  * Look for _contribution_ and _impact_.
