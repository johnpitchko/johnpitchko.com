title: The Ordinary Leader
author: Randy Grieser
---

Not every leader is a [Jack Welch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Welch), or a [Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi). In fact, most leaders are average people trying their best to lead their team to greatness, whether that be in business, amateur sports, or a volunteer organization.

The author of the book, [Randy Grieser](https://theordinaryleader.com/about-randy/), wrote this book from his experience as a leader for his two businesses, the [ACHIEVE Centre for Leadership & Workplace Performance](https://ca.achievecentre.com/), and the [Crisis & Trauma Resource Institute (CTRI)](https://ca.ctrinstitute.com/). A portion of Grieser's business comes from facilitating workshops on and giving presentations on leadership and management.

Book stores contain countless books listing the essential characteristics of strong leadership. Every business leader seems to have their own particular set of traits they found to be key to their success. Read enough of these books and I am sure you will discover that every single human quality is fundamental to effective leadership. May I suggest skimming my review of [__Developing Leadership Character__](http://localhost:4000/books2/2018-07-25-developing-leadership-character.html) for a different list of 11 leadership traits?

Sarcasm aside, there is one key difference about the attributes listed in __Developing Leadership Character__ and this book. Upon careful analysis, it appears that the traits listed in __The Ordinary Leader__ seem more behaviour-based than ones listed in __Developing Leadership Character__. In that book, the qualities are much more mental looking more at the inherit personality of the leader rather than the specific actions they execute in the organization.

Although the authors of that book provides resources (links to books and videos) to improve these characteristics, I personally believe that making significant improvements is quite challenging. These mental traits are the core personality of a person. Personality is developed over the entire life of a person, beginning from their early childhood. I would not go so far to say that traits such as _judgement_ and _drive_ cannot be developed, but rather that doing so requires much more than watching YouTube videos. Only through intense [deliberate practice](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/peak/) over years will one become better at these core traits. However, becoming more aware and seeing new perspectives on some of these traits is the first step to positive change.

Contrast the personality traits listed in __Developing Leadership Character__ to those found in this book. The key difference, in my opinion, is that the characteristics listed in __The Ordinary Leader__ are more behavioural and external-facing. For the most part, these are actions that a leader can practice, evaluate, and change in their own work as a leader. Furthermore, these behaviours can be nurtured across the whole leadership team, and even down the hierarchy. As senior leaders make conscious effort to demonstrate these behaviours, they can coach the mid- and front-line leaders to also improve performance.

Perhaps focusing on behavioural traits rather than mental traits was completely intentional by Grieser. After all, the book is titled __The _Ordinary_ Leader__ rather than __The _Perfect_ Leader__. Behavioural traits (i.e. how someone chooses to lead an organization) are within reach of everyone, and are much more feasible to developed. Regardless of background factors such as personality, education, experience, or wealth, any leader follow the insights suggested by Grieser. Every leader can choose to motivate employees or delegate effectively. Exceling at leadership is not a privilege granted to graduates of [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx) or CEOs of [Fortune 500](http://fortune.com/fortune500/) companies. Great leadership is within reach of all ordinary people.
