If you ask just about anyone about who they think are the best performing corporations and CEOs, you will probably hear the same responses. Names such as Steve Jobs from Apple, Jack Welch from General Electric, and Elon Musk of Paypal and Tesla will be repeated over and over. no doubt these are great leaders who lead major innovation and growth within their businesses. But are Jobs, Welch, and Musk truly well-known for their innovation and corporate success, or rather for their ability to capture the public's attention through media spotlight?

Names that you are unlikely to hear are Bill Stiritz of Ralston Purina, Henry Singleton of Teledyne, and Tom Murphy of Capital Cities. Yet these leaders and their companies are some of the best performing companies ever, even outperforming the S&P 500 at times by more than 20%.

Discovering their secret was the mystery that [William N. Thorndike Jr.](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=126367&privcapId=2567522) set out to solve with his book, **[The Outsiders](https://www.amazon.ca/Outsiders-Unconventional-Radically-Rational-Blueprint/dp/1422162672)**. Through his research, Thorndike identified eight companies that achieved similar levels of unexplainable success, and analyzed the characteristics about their leaders. These leaders are:

1. [Bill Stiritz](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=201655&privcapId=140950927) of Ralston Purina
1. [Henry Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Earl_Singleton) of [Teledyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledyne_Technologies)
1. [Tom Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Murphy_(broadcasting)) of [Capital Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Cities/ABC_Inc.)
1. [Bill Anders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Anders)s of [General Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics)
1. [John Malone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Malone) of [TCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tele-Communications_Inc.)
1. [Katharine Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Graham) of [The Washington Post Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post)
1. [Dick Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._Smith_(businessman)) of [General Cinemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres)
1. [Warren Buffet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett) of [Berkshire Hathaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway)

What Thorndike discovered was that these leaders thought and behaved counter to what popular culture and business schools considered to be the ideal traits of a successful leader. In fact, the characteristics that made these leaders so successful were so opposite of the commonly held beliefs of the ideal traits of a CEO, Thorndike dubbed them as *"Outsiders"*. Where many business experts feel that the best CEOs in modern times have combine deep market knowledge, significant management experience, and outspoken nature, Thorndike demonstrates that the best performing companies are lead by analytical individuals focused on achieving high shareholder value and cash flow.

Thorndike states that a key reason to the success of these outsider CEOs is how they allocate capital. Capital allocation is a process for how a CEO determines how to dole out cash in an enterprise. Cash can come from many sources, but the book focuses on cash generated through operations (rather than equity sale or leveraging). A CEO typically has 4 options available for excess cash; distribute to business units to grow the business, pay down debt or other obligations, return to shareholders via dividend or share buyback, or acquire new businesses. CEOs need to constantly analyze their business and industry to determine which combination of these four options will provide the best return to shareholders in the short or long term.

Praised by [Warren Buffet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffet), the book provides inspiration to those who desire to lead companies but do not see themselves as CEO-material. It reminds individuals that there is no single recipe to create a great business leader. No one should look down upon themselves because they feel that they do not compare with the tycoons that the media and popular culture are obsessed with. Ultimately, anyone driven to succeed is capable of leading a successful enterprise.
