title: All Marketers are Liars
author: Seth Godin

A useful book for those of us without a marketing background. Godin discusses how the best marketers are the best storytellers. He explains the key to a successful marketing campaign is to craft a compelling story that hooks the target customer.

Furthermore, he explains that all consumers have a 'worldview' - their personal perspective on everything around them. These worldview are not always unique; many people can share the same worldview. It is up to marketers to identify an under-served customer segment with a shared worldview, and frame their product's story around that worldview. That story becomes very difficult to resist as it resonates exactly with the beliefs of the target customer.

I feel this closely resonates with Simon Sinek's __'Start with Why'__. Sinek shows the importance for a company to define its purpose and values before selling products. Godin takes this concept a step further, describing the quest for finding customers with a certain worldview, then framing the 'Why' of the company around it.
