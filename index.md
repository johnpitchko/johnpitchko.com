Presently, I work as the **_Associate Dean_** for the [School of Information and Communications Technologies](https://www.sait.ca/about-sait/who-we-are/sait-schools/school-of-information-and-communications-technologies) at [SAIT Polytechnic](https://www.sait.ca), an accredited public technical college in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. My goal is to make technology and media education more accessible and relevant to students. Everyday, I lead a team of more than 150 academic chairs, instructors, and support staff to teach more than 2,500 students each year within nine diplomas, three post-diploma certificates, and six Fast-track[^2] programs.

In previous years, I worked for two years as an **_Advisor_** at [Platform Calgary](https://platformcalgary.com)[^1], consulting with Calgary-based technology startups on business strategy, sales and marketing, and lean startup methodology. One of my key accomplishments at Platform Calgary was launching the [TELUS Technology Accelerator](https://calgarytechnologies.com/telus/), a partnership between Platform Calgary and [TELUS](https://www.telus.com), that has accelerated over 15 technology startups in BC and Alberta in the fields such as digital health, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications.

I also spent 11 years as a **_Project Manager_** at [Shell Canada](https://www.shell.ca), deploying technology solutions within Shell Canada's national retail and oil sands businesses. During my final three years, I lead projects in Shell's global mobility centre of excellence, designing custom mobile apps for industrial workers using [SAP Fiori](https://www.sap.com/canada/products/fiori.html) allowing workers to spend less time in front of their computers and more time working in the field.
