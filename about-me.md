# My name is __John Pitchko__ and I want to transform higher education.

Presently, I work as the __Associate Dean__ for the [School of Information and Communications Technologies](https://www.sait.ca/about-sait/who-we-are/sait-schools/school-of-information-and-communications-technologies) at [SAIT Polytechnic](https://www.sait.ca), an accredited public technical college in Calgary, AB. My goal is to make technology and media education more accessible and relevant to students. Everyday, I work with more than 100 academic chairs, instructors, and support staff to teach more than 1,400 students each year within nine diploma and six post-diploma certificate programs.

In previous years, I worked for two years as an __Advisor__ at [Calgary Technologies Inc.](https://calgarytechnologies.com) (also known as CTI and formerly known as Innovate Calgary), consulting with Calgary-based technology startups on business strategy, sales and marketing, and lean startup methodology. One of my key accomplishments at CTI was launching the [TELUS Technology Accelerator](https://calgarytechnologies.com/telus/), a partnership between CTI and [TELUS](https://www.telus.com), that has accelerated over 15 technology startups in BC and Alberta in the fields such as digital health, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications.

I also spent 11 years as a __Project Manager__ at [Shell Canada](https://www.shell.ca), deploying technology solutions within Shell's national retail and oil sands businesses. During my final three years, I lead projects in Shell's global mobility centre of excellence, designing custom mobile apps for industrial workers using [SAP Fiori](https://www.sap.com/canada/products/fiori.html) allowing workers to spend less time in front of their computers and more time working in the field.
