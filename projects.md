<!-- ### Discover

A six-week applied program guiding participants through the early phases of the Customer Development Lifecycle. Participants were guided through mapping their startup ideas onto a Business Model Canvas, then tasked with interviewing their target customers to confirm their assumptions. Results were analyzed in a group setting to identify trends and new insights. At the end of the course, participants presented their findings to a group of serial entrepreneurs to gather their perspective.

> "Having my feet held to the fire has been great. I was ready to launch something which surely would have flopped because I haven’t done the research."
> <cite>– Tristan Zastrow</cite>

> "I would highly recommend the Discover program to anyone considering starting a company in Calgary. It was a great way to field test your idea."
> <cite>– Mike Webster</cite> -->

<!-- ### Validate
A follow-up program to Discover sharing many similarities. An eight-week applied course where participants continue developing their startup through Customer Development. Using the information gathered from customer engagement in Discover, participants design and build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Participants then provide their MVP to customers to provide feedback, which is used to further iterate their design and business model. The program concluded with another presentation to serial entrepreneurs to gather their perspective and allow the participant an opportunity to be introspective about the viability of their idea and their passion to move forward. -->
